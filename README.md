# 🔗 **Eternal Link** 🔗

**Eternal Link** is a lighthearted project I made to troll my classmates! It masquerades as a mysterious relationship checker, but in reality, it's just a playful twist on the FLAMES game. The fun part? Since all data is stored in MongoDB, I can check out their crushes with just a peek at the DB! 😏

## Features
- Enter two names and answer a few fun questions.
- Get hilarious relationship results (Friends, Love, Marriage, and more).
- Dark-themed for added mystery!

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Database:** MongoDB (for storing your secrets 💌)

## Instructions
1. Clone and run locally (`python app.py`).
2. Enter your details and see what "fate" awaits!

## Note
All for fun — no serious matchmaking here, just me trolling classmates with their crushes!
